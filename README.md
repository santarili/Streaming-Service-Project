## Analysis of key metrics for a video streaming service

This project explores the search for metrics necessary for a video streaming platform, utilizing Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, and Tableau. It all starts with SQL queries to gather relevant data, then transitions to exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. Subsequently, informative Tableau dashboards are created to visualize insights obtained from the research, covering areas such as user engagement, popular content, and strategies as customer acquisition tools. The work concludes with recommendations that can be implemented to optimize production and marketing strategy.

This repository contains:
- **sql-queries** folder: Contains queries to the database
- **data** folder: Stores all data obtained from SQL queries
- **dashboard** folder: Contains Tableau dashboards in various formats.
