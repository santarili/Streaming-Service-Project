Analysis of key metrics for a video streaming service | Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, Tableau

This project delves into analyzing crucial metrics for a video streaming platform using Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, and Tableau. Beginning with SQL queries to collect pertinent data, it progresses to exploratory data analysis (EDA) employing Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Subsequently, Tableau dashboards are crafted to visualize insights gleaned from the analysis, covering areas such as user engagement, content popularity, and acquisition channels. The project culminates in actionable recommendations to optimize product features and marketing strategies. 

This repository contains:
- SQL queries folder: Contains queries to the database
- Data folder: Stores all data obtained from SQL queries
- Dashboard folder: Contains Tableau dashboards in various formats.
